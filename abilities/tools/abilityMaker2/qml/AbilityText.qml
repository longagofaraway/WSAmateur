    text: "Great 5-star Polearms that perform above the rest thanks to their secondary stats and useful passives.

Calamity Queller is a slightly stronger option when there’s a lack of ATK% or ATK-related buffs like Shenhe’s Icy Quill. Fractured Halo and Staff of Homa perform marginally better with Shenhe on the team."
